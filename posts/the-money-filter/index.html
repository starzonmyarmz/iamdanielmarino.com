    <h1>The Money Filter</h1>

  <section class="post-content">
    <p>One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced as a web designer is how often people expect a website for next to nothing. Somewhere along the way, the perception formed that a website is a commodity—quick, cheap, and interchangeable. So when someone asks what I charge (for a very basic marketing site), I usually reply, <em>“That’ll cost around $5,000.”</em></p>
<p>That number isn’t a gimmick—it’s a filter. It immediately reveals who understands the craft behind the screen, who values quality, and who’s serious about investing in their own business. It separates those looking for something fast and inexpensive from those seeking something <em>purposeful</em> and <em>crafted</em>.</p>
<p>It used to frustrate me when people balked at the cost. Now? I see it as a helpful sorting mechanism. It shows me who I actually want to work with.</p>
<h2>The Cost of “Cheap”</h2>
<p>There’s no shortage of DIY website builders promising professional results at a low price. And honestly—sometimes that’s <em>fine</em>. If you just need something quick and functional, a template might be all you need.</p>
<p>But a boutique website is something entirely different.</p>
<p>When you hire me, you’re not buying convenience—you’re investing in craft. A boutique site is designed <em>and</em> engineered specifically for you. It’s not a template dressed up with new colors. It’s built intentionally, shaped around your goals, your audience, your brand’s personality, and the experience you want people to have.</p>
<p>And cheap solutions often come with hidden costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>lost conversions</li>
<li>poor usability and performance</li>
<li>accessibility issues</li>
<li>a generic, forgettable brand presence</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of a bespoke website isn’t just in what it <em>does</em>. It’s in <em>how</em> it’s made—and what it communicates about you.</p>
<h2>Why Bespoke Work Matters</h2>
<p>When I build a custom website, it’s not just about aesthetics. It’s about alignment—making sure every part of the experience supports your story, your content, and your clients’ needs. Every choice—typography, layout, semantics, performance—is intentional.</p>
<p>Anyone can make a website that <em>looks</em> good.
<em>I handcraft websites that feel right and function beautifully.</em></p>
<p>As a <strong>design engineer</strong>, I don’t hand off a static mockup and hope the final result captures the original intent. I design with the intent to build, carrying the project from concept to code so the final experience is cohesive, thoughtful, and true to the vision. That’s what boutique design is: every pixel and every line of code has purpose.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If you only need a website, you don’t need me.</p>
<p>But if you want a <em>boutique digital experience</em>—something that reflects your values, your vision, and your commitment to quality—then I’m the right fit.</p>
<p>You’re not paying for a website. You’re paying for craftsmanship, collaboration, and care. And while not everyone values that, the right clients do. My pricing isn’t just a number—it’s a filter that helps me focus on the people who appreciate the work, the craft, and the impact it can create.</p>
