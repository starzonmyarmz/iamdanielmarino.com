    <h1>Making Generative Art</h1>

  <section class="post-content">
    <p>I saw <a href="https://joshuadavis.com/">Joshua Davis</a> give a talk over 10 years ago, and I was mesmorized. Not just by how engaging he was, but more so with the work he was doing with <em>generative art</em>.</p>
<p>I had never heard of generative art before, but I immediately fell in love with the concept of it. I like to draw, but I wouldn't consider myself much of an artist. I can work my way around Photoshop pretty comfortably, but again, wouldn't consider myself much of an artist. I didn't think much of generative art again for some time later.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I started toying with the idea fo experimenting with generative art. A buddy of mine, <a href="https://codepen.io/satchmorun">Arun</a> shared some of his work, and inspired me to go for it. So now I've been creating generative art for the past five years or so, but I've only recently started <a href="https://starzonmyarmz.github.io/generative-art/">sharing my experiments</a>.</p>
<p>Libraries like <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> make it very approachable. And I'm a huge fan of P5! I even <a href="https://iamdanielmarino.com/posts/github-game-off-game-jam-2021-retrospective/">made a video game</a> with it. If you have the slightest interest in creating generative art, you should go for it! If you don't know where to start, I recommend checking out <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">The Coding Train</a> where you'll find some great tutorials for getting started with programming, and more specific tutorials for using the P5 library.</p>
<p>I love to write code. I love art. I love being creative. The idea that I can combine all these into a single hobby is so cool.</p>
