  <section class="post-content">
    <p>I was messing around with <a href="https://p5play.org/">p5play</a> last week to experiment with a game idea, and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to use. It was designed to be intuitive for beginners, such as students. In under a half hour I had created some common basic mechanics! Check it out:</p>

<h3>What I Like</h3>
<ul>
<li>It builds on top of <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>. This means that I can leverage all the built-in features I'm already familiar with in P5. It even expands upon some built-in features in P5â€”like creating a new <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/canvas.html">Canvas</a>.</li>
<li>It uses the same <a href="https://piqnt.com/planck.js">Box2D physics simulator</a> that some popular games use. Some physics engines are a little floaty, while others are too constrained. This simulator has some really comfortable defaults out of the box.</li>
<li>The documentation is easy to follow along, and there's a <a href="https://discord.gg/3UTbqUgmPF">Discord server</a> where I can (and have) ask questions. I typically have gotten a response from the library maintainer, himself, within a couple of hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Dislike</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not everything is documented, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. However, there are some really handy properties and even methods available that I happened to come across by accident just from purusing the source code and outputting various p5play global methods to <code>console.log()</code>.</li>
<li>The licensing is a <a href="https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play-web/blob/main/LICENSING.md">little weird</a>. In short: its free to use for open source projects, but for professional use you need to pay for a license. I'm not going to argue whether you should have to pay for a license or not, but its definately something to be aware of.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll definitely be keeping <a href="https://p5play.org/">p5play</a> in my toolkit the next time I want to prototype some game mechanics or participate in a game jam!</p>
