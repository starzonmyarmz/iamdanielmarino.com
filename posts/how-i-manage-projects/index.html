      <section class="post-content">
        <p>As a Product Designer at <a href="https://getharvest.com">Harvest</a>, part of my role is running projects. While I don’t believe there is a <em>right</em> or <em>wrong</em> way to manage projects, I do think there are some methods that can yield better results. I’m hardly an expert in this area. My intent here is to simply shed a little light on my methods.</p>
<p>I try to stay out of the way as much as possible, leaving room for my teammates to get their work done. Their time, much like mine, is valuable. Out of respect, I try not to gum up the works with unnecessary meetings or emails. This doesn’t mean I’m out of the loop. We still keep tabs on each other, and are all generally aware of what the other person is working on.</p>
<h3>The Kickoff Meeting</h3>
<p>In preparation for the <em>Kickoff</em>, I prefer creating a Google Doc with the project details rather than a slideshow. This makes it easier to review and edit on the fly, and not get hung up on the little things like <em>does this slide look pretty</em>.</p>
<p>Typically, I keep the Kickoff to 30 minutes or less. This isn’t the place to figure out technical or design decisions. We still might kick around some ideas and ask questions. We typically breakout into smaller groups as needed. I prefer to having the Kickoff the Friday before the project starts. This allows my distributed team to hit the ground running first thing Monday morning.</p>
<h3>Weekly Hangout</h3>
<p>Once a week, our team will meet over a Google Hangout for about 20–30 minutes to discuss updates. We don’t necessarily try to solve problems in these meetings unless they’re quick and easy. These hangouts are more or less to make sure we’re all on the same page over the course of the project.</p>
<h3>Daily Slack Check-in</h3>
<p>Rather than having more face-to-face meetings or emailed checkins, I prefer daily check-ins on <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. Simply put, I hate meetings, and find that most others do too. They disrupt the flow of my work day, and I suspect they do for others too. I also hate email because it requires an action (read and respond/archive). If I’m working with 5 other people on a project, and each one emails me an update - that’s upwards of 25 responses a week!</p>
<p>I much prefer Slack because it’s asynchronous. I get to it as breaks occur naturally throughout. I ask teammates to write a one- or two-sentence update. Basically what are you working on and is anything blocking you from completing it. Short and sweet.</p>
<p>Of course, if something is pressing or I’m blocking a todo from progressing, I ask my teammates to @ me, so that I get an immediate notification.</p>
<h3>Todos on Basecamp</h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> at Harvest. Everyone on the team is responsible for making todos. That means a developer may create multiple todos for building out a feature or creating a todo for me to apply some design polish. I ask my teammates to create todos based on what they think needs to be done.</p>
<p>That’s the bulk of it. Of course there are little things here and there that I didn’t go over, but this should give you a glimpse into how I manage projects.</p>
