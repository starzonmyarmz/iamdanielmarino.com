  <section class="post-content">
    <p>I’m a bit late to this, but back in summer 2024 I participated in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ost-composing-jam-7">OST Composing Jam</a>. The goal of this jam is to compose an original soundtrack (minimum of 3 minutes) of any style for an imaginary game. While I’ve composed a lot of video game music, I’ve never created an entire soundtrack around a single concept.</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 310px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3143278153/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=eb4d55/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://danielmarino.bandcamp.com/album/self-avoiding-walk">Self Avoiding Walk by Daniel Marino</a></iframe>
<p>To be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure where to start. I was torn between trying to come up with a story for a game to inspire the music, and just messing around with some synths and noodling on the keyboard. I did a little bit of both, but nothing really materialized.</p>
<h2>Synth + Metal ≈ Synthmetal</h2>
<p>Feeling a bit paralyzed, I fired up the ’ole <a href="https://rmg.iamdanielmarino.com/">RMG sequencer</a> for inspiration. I saved a handful of randomized melodies and experimented with them in Reaper. After a day or two I landed on something I liked which was about the first 30 seconds or so of the second track: &quot;Defrag.&quot;</p>
<p>I love metal bands like Tesseract, Periphery, The Algorithm, Car Bomb, and Meshuggah. I tried experimenting with incorporating syncopated guttural guitar sounds with the synths. After several more days I finished &quot;Defrag&quot;—which also included &quot;Kernel Panic&quot; before splitting that into its own track. I didn’t have a clue what to do next, nor did I have a concept. Composing the rest of the music was a bit of a blur because I bounced around from song to song—iterating on the leitmotif over and over with different synths, envelopes, time signatures, rhythmic displacement, pitch shifting, and tweaking underlying chord structures.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>The guitars were recorded using DI with my Fender Squire and <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UMC202HD--behringer-u-phoria-umc202hd-usb-audio-interface">Behringer Interface</a>. I’m primarily using the ML Sound Labs <a href="https://ml-sound-lab.com/products/amped-roots">Amped Roots Free</a> amp sim because the metal presets are fantastic and rarely need much fuss to get it sounding good. I also used <a href="https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_FreeAmp/">Blue Cat Audio free amp</a> sim for clean guitars.</p>

<p>All the other instruments were MIDI tracks either programmed via piano roll or recorded with my <a href="https://www.arturia.com/minilab-mkii/resources">Arturia MiniLab MKII</a>. I used a variety of synth effects from <a href="https://iamdanielmarino.com/posts/what-im-using-2025/">my library of VSTs</a>. I recorded this music before acquiring my Fender Squire Bass guitar, so bass was also programmed.</p>
<h2>Theme and Story</h2>
<p>At some point I had five songs that all sounded like they could be from the same game. The theme for this particular jam was &quot;Inside my world.&quot; I had to figure out how I could write a story that corresponded with the theme and could align with the songs. I somehow landed on the idea of the main actor realizing his addiction to AI, embarking on a journey to &quot;unplug.&quot; The music reflects his path to recovery, capturing the emotional and psychological evolution as he seeks to overcome his dependency. After figuring this out, I thought it would be cool to name all the songs using computer terms that could be metaphors for the different stages of recovery.</p>
<h2>Track listing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Worm</strong> – In this dark and haunting opening track, the actor grapples with his addiction to AI, realizing he can no longer think independently.</li>
<li><strong>Defrag</strong> – This energetic track captures the physical and emotional struggles of the early stages of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel Panic</strong> – Menacing and eerie, this track portrays the actor’s anxiety and panic attacks as he teeters on the brink during the initial phases of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Dæmons</strong> – With initial healing achieved, the real challenge begins. The ominous and chaotic melodies reflect the emotional turbulence the character endures.</li>
<li><strong>Time to Live</strong> – The actor, having come to terms with himself, experiences emotional growth. The heroic climax symbolizes the realization that recovery is a lifelong journey.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Album art</h2>
<p>At the time I was messing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk">Self-avoiding walks</a> in generative artwork explorations. I felt like the whole concept of avoiding the self within the context of addiction and recovery metaphorically worked. So I tweaked some algorithms and generated the self-avoiding walk using JavaScript and the <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> library. I then layered the self-avoiding walk over a <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-brown-and-yellow-substance-Smpy9LZmksY">photo I found visually interesting</a> on Unsplash using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode">CSS blend mode</a>.</p>

<h2>Jam results</h2>
<p>I placed around the top 50% out of over 600 entries. I would have liked to have placed higher, but despite my ranking, I thoroughly enjoyed composing the music! I’m very happy with the music, its production quality, and I also learned a lot. I would certainly participate in this style of composition jam again!</p>
