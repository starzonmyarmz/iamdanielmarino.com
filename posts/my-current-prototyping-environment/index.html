    <h1>My current prototyping environment</h1>

  <section class="post-content">
    <p>The other day I shared <a href="/posts/why-i-still-prefer-prototyping-using-code/">why I prefer coding prototypes</a> rather than using design apps to create them. My prototyping environment has evolved over the years. I love to hear how others build prototypes, so I thought I’d share where I’m at now. Maybe you’ll find it useful.</p>
<h2>A single repository</h2>
<p>I currently have a <a href="https://github.com/starzonmyarmz/prototypes">single GitHub repo</a> housing all of my prototypes. I do this primarily so I don’t have to remember where any given prototype lives. They all live in the same place! Another benefit is if I pull in a library or some CSS component, I can reuse it in other prototypes without having to go out and grab it from the source again.</p>
<h2>My old setup</h2>
<p>In the past I used <a href="https://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> hosted on Heroku. Having Ruby and a basic server (Such as <a href="https://github.com/ruby/webrick">Webrick</a>) in the backend was pretty nice:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could code up some fairly complex prototypes out with realistic url schemes.</li>
<li>Gems! If I needed fake data, I could use the <a href="https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker">Faker gem</a>.</li>
<li>If I wanted a table with a 100 rows, I could easily generate that with a super simple loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it got clunky. Spinning up a new prototype wasn’t very efficient. Setting up the urls took time. Deploying to Heroku wasn’t always straight forward. Heroku also got rid of their free plan, and I didn’t want to go looking for a new service. Maybe I’m making excuses.</p>
<h2>A dumb server</h2>
<p>Now I just use HTML, CSS (vanilla), and Javascript with no special backend. I don’t have Node.js running, and I don’t use a package manager like NPM or Yarn. To start a server I navigate to the prototype directory in iTerm, and run <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/statikk">Statikk</a>. Easy peasy. This setup requires no upkeep, so I can focus on actually prototyping!</p>
<p>I have a basic file structure for keeping prototypes separate. I typically use <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> for scaffolding. To <code>import</code>  Preact or other NPM packages I use <a href="https://esm.sh/">esm.sh</a>. When I push changes to the GitHub repo it’s deployed to GitHub pages. I can then share a public URL to folks that need to review the prototype.</p>
<h2>One glaring problem</h2>
<p>There’s only one issue I’ve run into using this setup, and its not even related to the setup! The <a href="https://porchlight.design/">Porchlight design system</a> (which we use at <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a>) doesn’t have it’s styles or components available to consume publicly via CDN. Womp womp.</p>
<p>I can get around the CSS issue. I end up having to copy the compiled CSS from the design system and paste it into a new file in my prototype environment. And I’m kind of out of luck with the JavaScript: I have to code these up from scratch. Although, I suppose I could copy the compiled components, and paste them into my prototype environment.</p>
<p>The easiest fix is probably to introduce a package manager, but I’d rather not. We have talked about making the design system’s CSS and components available via CDN–it’s just a matter of getting around to it.</p>
<h2>Prototype!</h2>
<p>So that’s my current prototyping setup. Maybe it will help inspire you to setup your own prototyping environment. Whether you use code or a design app–you should prototype!</p>
