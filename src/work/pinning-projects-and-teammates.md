Reviewing projects, teammates, and pending timesheets can sometimes be a bummer when it comes to quickly finding the information that matters most to you. You don’t need to see everything all the time. And nobody wants to scroll through a long list of projects or teammates to find the handful that are important now.

If you’ve found it difficult to focus on what you need, when you need it, I’ve got some good news. We’ve just made it a little bit easier to find the projects or teammates that’re most important!

Pin Projects and Teammates to Prioritize Your View
Most of the time, most people want to report on only a handful of projects or people. And those may not necessarily be the same projects or people your teammates focus on. Plus, the rest of Harvest’s data might be important every few weeks or months, but not every day.

On the Projects and Team Overviews, we’ve added the ability to pin projects and teammates to the top of the page! The great thing about pinning is that it’s personalized to you.
