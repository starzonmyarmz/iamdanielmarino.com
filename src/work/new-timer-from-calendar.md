In an ongoing effort to encourage effective time tracking, [Harvest](https://getharvest.com) uncovered a compelling insight during our research: nearly 50% of customers in a specific segment were concurrently using their calendar app alongside Harvest for time tracking. Recognizing this pattern, we initiated a six-week project aimed at simplifying the process of seamlessly transferring calendar events into users' Harvest timesheets.

For this undertaking, my role extended to project management, encompassing the design and prototyping of user flows, as well as collaborative engagement with engineers during the implementation phase.

## Problem

As the demands of busy schedules intensify, carving out dedicated time to fill out a timesheet becomes increasingly challenging. The typical scenario involves individuals transitioning rapidly between tasks, leaving their timesheets neglected. When users finally sit down to record their time, the arduous task of recollecting specific details and reconstructing days or weeks of work poses a significant hurdle.

### Remembering Time is Difficult

- **Objective:** Mitigate the challenge of remembering tasks and activities.
- **Solution:** Develop a mechanism to simplify the process of entering time entries from calendar events.

### Streamline creating time entries from calendar events

- **Objective:** Empower users to seamlessly integrate calendar events into their Harvest timesheet.
- **Solution:** Introduce a feature that connects with Google or Outlook.com calendar accounts, automatically pulling events into the timesheet for easy entry.

## Challenges

- **Integrating with 3rd Parties:** Ensuring seamless integration with external calendar platforms through APIs.
- **Ongoing Commitment to Maintenance:** Upholding the commitment to regularly update and maintain the system.
- **Decision-Making for System Evolution:** Making decisions on system evolution, including potential integrations and enhancements.

## Approach

The project unfolded with a well-defined vision aimed at tackling the identified challenges head-on.

In the initial phase, the engineering team dived into the intricacies of technical discovery and seamless integration with Google and Outlook.com calandars, while my focus shifted towards materializing concepts into mockups and clickable prototypes utilizing Sketch.

Over the span of two weeks, a continuous cycle of development, presentation, and refinement ensued as I iteratively shaped the mockups and prototypes. These iterations were subjected to rigorous design reviews, incorporating valuable feedback to enhance the user experience. The culmination of this design process involved subjecting the finalized prototype to thorough scrutiny, garnering the approval of the company founder and cementing the chosen approach.

Post-approval, my role expanded to actively contribute to the front-end engineering efforts, in the creation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. As the project neared completion, I coordinated quality assurance efforts, created marketing materials to showcase the new feature, and helped facilite the seamless launch of the new feature.

## Tracking Progress

The integration allowed batch time-tracking customers to create timers based on Google Calendar integrated suggestions. Setting an ambitious goal of 10% of timers for this audience segment originating from calendar events in three months, we not only met but exceeded expectations, achieving 17% of timers started from calendar events.

## Future

The successful implementation of the Harvest Timesheets Calendar Integration feature positions Harvest to provide users with a faster and more user-friendly approach to time tracking. As an evolving project, we remain committed to continuous iteration, adaptation, and the extraction of valuable insights from the ongoing process.
