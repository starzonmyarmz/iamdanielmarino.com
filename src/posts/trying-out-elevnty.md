As I started to think about blogging again, I began looking at options for hosting, CMS frameworks, static site generators, etc. [Eleventy](http://www.11ty.dev) has been in the mainstream for sometime now, and I've heard nothing but good things about it. I figured I should give it a shot.

There are no shortage of examples for using Eleventy, but I particularly found [Andy Bellâ€™s](https://hankchizljaw.com/) [Hebra](https://hebra.dev/) starter kit, as well as the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) to be excellent resources. I'm using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for templating. It more or less feels like [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) which I'm familiar with from having used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), as well as creating [State Motto Prints](https://www.statemottoprints.com/).

In the course of an afternoon, I was able to put together the [bones of this redesign](https://github.com/starzonmyarmz/iamdanielmarino.com). Over the past week, during my spare time, I've been adding polish, and getting deployments working with Github Pages. I'll continue to make tweaks here and there, but overall I feel good about it.
