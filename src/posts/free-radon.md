A little over a year ago, I composed a handful of songs. If I had to fit them into a genre, I’d go with _Lofi_ or _Chillvibes_. Or maybe _Not-Rock-n-Roll_. I don’t know—I’m so bad at classifying music.

I wasn’t sure what to do with the songs. I was experiencing some intense emotions when I was composing them. I’ve been doing a lot of emotional growth over this past year (and still am), and I feel like by releasing them into the wild would be cathartic for me. To acknowledge that that chapter in my life happened, and it’s okay. So with that, here’s [Free Radon](https://danielmarino.bandcamp.com/album/free-radon).

So why *Free Radon*? I’d like to say I put a lot of thought into naming the album, but I didn’t. I needed cover art for the album, and I thought it would be fun to generate random artwork for it. So I used the [p5.js JavaScript library](https://p5js.org/) to do so. I used the p5.js web editor, and when you create a new sketch it automatically creates a random name for it—in this case Free Radon. Speaking of using p5.js to create the artwork, you can [view the script](https://editor.p5js.org/iamdanielmarino/sketches/0QgAM4zz3), and mess around with it.

Hope you like the music. If you do, [share it with others](https://danielmarino.bandcamp.com/album/free-radon), or [buy it](https://danielmarino.bandcamp.com/album/free-radon), or [both](https://danielmarino.bandcamp.com/album/free-radon)! If you don’t like it… oh well.
