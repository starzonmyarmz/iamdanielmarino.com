title: What I‚Äôm Using in 2025

I‚Äôve always been fascinated to see what other apps or workflows others are using in their day-to-day lives. Every now and then I learn about a new app or some cool trick I didn‚Äôt previously know. I doubt anyone seriously cares about what I‚Äôm using, but figured I‚Äôd list them out anyway‚Äîif for no other reason than to keep a historical record at this point in time.

## Applications

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) ‚Äî I have a lifelong license, and I like it. No point in fixing something that isn‚Äôt broken. I primarily use it for app switching, but also use it for math, and to [search for gifs](/posts/my-gif-workflow-using-eleventy-netlify-alfred/).
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) ‚Äî Sometimes I do pixel art! Even if the UI is clunky, and some keyboard shortcuts aren‚Äôt always convenient, there are some unique features that help facilitate creating pixel art.
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) ‚Äî I rarely use it, but sometimes it‚Äôs easier to make some quick audio edits with Audacity than to use a full blown [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation).
- [Bear](https://bear.app/) ‚Äî This is the note-taking, task-tacking app I‚Äôve landed on. The UI is beautiful and it feels snappy. It syncs, so I can use it on my iPhone too.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) ‚Äî I used [Arc](https://arc.net/) for the better part of 2024, but after they announced they were done working on it to focus on a new AI-powered browser, I peaced out. There are a couple of features I really missed, but was able to find some extensions to fill those gaps: [Copy Current Tab URL](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/copy-current-tab-url/kjfaieigmkklodbpcnadhkmbfjapgljd), [Meetings Page Auto Closer for Zoom](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/meetings-page-auto-closer/pbgidoglkjhfgjhalbbiiahdlokjcplb), [Open Figma app](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/open-figma-app/hgeipfdfhbmmgbkdjbeplocahpgkpkal), and [JSON Formatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) ‚Äî I use it because it‚Äôs what we use at work. I‚Äôm happy enough with Figma.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) ‚Äî Has a few features that I like that makes me chose this over Mac‚Äôs native Terminal app.
- [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt paid the Adobe tax for a long time, and it feels good. I started using Pixelmator because at the time it was the best alternative available. I‚Äôm comfortable with Pixelmator at this point. I don‚Äôt really use image editors often these days, so I probably won‚Äôt switch anytime soon.
- [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) ‚Äî My DAW of choice when composing music. It‚Äôs very customizable, easyish enough to learn, and the price is right. It also has a die hard community, so I‚Äôm always able to find help when I need it.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ‚Äî I‚Äôve tried a lot of code editors. I prefer [Sublime‚Äôs](https://www.sublimetext.com/) UI over VS Code, but VS Code does a lot of things more easily than Sublime does, so I put up with the UI.
- [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) ‚Äî I still miss [Rdio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio). YouTube Music works well enough I guess. Paying for YouTube Music has the benefit of not seeing ads on YouTube.


## Command-line Tools

These aren‚Äôt apps per se, but these are some tools that I use to help manage packages or that I use regularly when developing.

- [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Volta](https://volta.sh/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)


## Equipment

I have one computer and I use it for everything, and I‚Äôm okay with that. It‚Äôs more than powerful enough for work, composing music, making games, and occasionaly playing games.

Although I have a dedicated home office, lately I tend to work more on the go, often with just my laptop‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs at a cafe, a [coworking space](https://thecoworkinghouse.com/), or even just moving around the house.

## Virtual Instruments

This is quite specific for composing music, so if that does‚Äôt interest you, feel free to stop reading here. This list is not exhaustive as I‚Äôm regularly trying out new VSTs. These are some staples that I use:

- üéπ [Arturia Analog Lab V (Intro)](https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/analoglab/overview) ‚Äî My Arturia controller came with this software. It has over 500 presets and I love exploring the variety of sounds.
- üé∏ [Bass Grinder (Free)](https://plugins4free.com/plugin/2082/) ‚Äî I recently came across this VST, and it has a great crunchy overdrive sound for bass guitar.
- ü•Å [Manda Audio Power Drum Kit](https://www.powerdrumkit.com/) ‚Äî Even though you can use this for free, I paid the $9 because it is fantastic. The drums sound real and are great for all styles of music.
- üé∏ [ML Amped Roots (Free)](https://ml-sound-lab.com/products/amped-roots) ‚Äî What I like about this is that I get great metal guitar out of the box without having to add pedals or chaining other effects.
- ü•Å [ML Drums (Free)](https://ml-sound-lab.com/pages/ml-drums) ‚Äî I just started experimenting with this, and the drum tones are amazing. The free set up is pretty limited, but I like how I can add on to the base drum kit to meet my needs rather than having having to buy one big extensive drum VST.
- üéπ [Spitfire LABS](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/) ‚Äî More variety of eclectic sounds.

I also use several built-in VSTs made by Reaper for delay, EQ, reverb, pitch-shifting, and other effects. Reaper‚Äôs VSTs are insanely powerful enough for my needs and are much less CPU intensive.
