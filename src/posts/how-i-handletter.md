title: How I Handletter

When I first got into hand-lettering, I had a hard time finding people who shared their *full* processâ€”especially the digitizing phase. So hereâ€™s a look at how I typically work. Everyoneâ€™s process is different, and a lot depends on your style and how you plan to present the piece. For me, since I donâ€™t have the steadiest hand, I tend to embrace rough, scrappy, distressed looks. Most of my work ends up digital anyway, so mistakes can be fixed later. Hereâ€™s a short process video I made a while back.

## Thumbnails & Sketching

- Start with quick thumbnail ideas on scrap paper.
- Refine the chosen direction with a pencil on Bristol Paper.
- If possible, I use a drawing pencil (softer, lighter lead makes cleanup easier).
- After inking, I clean up with an art gum eraser.


## Inking

- My go-tos are **Microns** in different thicknesses. In the video I sharedI used a `.08` for outlines and `Graphic 1` for filling letters.
- I used a **Gelly Roll 10** to add *cut-outs*, create depth, and fix small mistakes ðŸ˜¬.


## Digitizing

- I scan the inked artwork using [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-scan-documents/id333710667) on iOS.
- Clean up in [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/).
- Add textures for distress and wear (Iâ€™ve collected a bunch of texture packs over the years).


## Where Iâ€™ve Used This

This is basically the same process I followed for my [State Motto](/state-mottos/) series, and most of my other lettering projects.

Donâ€™t be afraid to lean into your natural tendencies (like a scrappier style if your hand isnâ€™t steady) and use the digital phase to enhance or correct. Trial and error is a huge part of it.
