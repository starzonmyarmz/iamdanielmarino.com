I’m a bit late to this, but back in summer 2024 I participated in the [OST Composing Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ost-composing-jam-7). The goal of this jam is to compose an original soundtrack (minimum of 3 minutes) of any style for an imaginary game. While I’ve composed a lot of video game music, I’ve never created an entire soundtrack around a single concept.

To be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure where to start. I was torn between trying to come up with a story for a game to inspire the music, and just messing around with some synths and noodling on the keyboard. I did a little bit of both, but nothing really materialized.

## Synth + Metal ≈ Synthmetal

Feeling a bit paralyzed, I fired up the ’ole [RMG sequencer](https://rmg.iamdanielmarino.com/) for inspiration. I saved a handful of randomized melodies and experimented with them in Reaper. After a day or two I landed on something I liked which was about the first 30 seconds or so of the second track: "Defrag."

I love metal bands like Tesseract, Periphery, The Algorithm, Car Bomb, and Meshuggah. I tried experimenting with incorporating syncopated guttural guitar sounds with the synths. After several more days I finished "Defrag"—which also included "Kernel Panic" before splitting that into its own track. I didn’t have a clue what to do next, nor did I have a concept. Composing the rest of the music was a bit of a blur because I bounced around from song to song—iterating on the leitmotif over and over with different synths, envelopes, time signatures, rhythmic displacement, pitch shifting, and tweaking underlying chord structures.

## Production

The guitars were recorded using DI with my Fender Squire and [Behringer Interface](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UMC202HD--behringer-u-phoria-umc202hd-usb-audio-interface). I’m primarily using the ML Sound Labs [Amped Roots Free](https://ml-sound-lab.com/products/amped-roots) amp sim because the metal presets are fantastic and rarely need much fuss to get it sounding good. I also used [Blue Cat Audio free amp](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_FreeAmp/) sim for clean guitars.

All the other instruments were MIDI tracks either programmed via piano roll or recorded with my [Arturia MiniLab MKII](https://www.arturia.com/minilab-mkii/resources). I used a variety of synth effects from [my library of VSTs](https://iamdanielmarino.com/posts/what-im-using-2025/). I recorded this music before acquiring my Fender Squire Bass guitar, so bass was also programmed.

## Theme and Story

At some point I had five songs that all sounded like they could be from the same game. The theme for this particular jam was "Inside my world." I had to figure out how I could write a story that corresponded with the theme and could align with the songs. I somehow landed on the idea of the main actor realizing his addiction to AI, embarking on a journey to "unplug." The music reflects his path to recovery, capturing the emotional and psychological evolution as he seeks to overcome his dependency. After figuring this out, I thought it would be cool to name all the songs using computer terms that could be metaphors for the different stages of recovery.

## Track listing

- **Worm** – In this dark and haunting opening track, the actor grapples with his addiction to AI, realizing he can no longer think independently.
- **Defrag** – This energetic track captures the physical and emotional struggles of the early stages of recovery.
- **Kernel Panic** – Menacing and eerie, this track portrays the actor’s anxiety and panic attacks as he teeters on the brink during the initial phases of recovery.
- **Dæmons** – With initial healing achieved, the real challenge begins. The ominous and chaotic melodies reflect the emotional turbulence the character endures.
- **Time to Live** – The actor, having come to terms with himself, experiences emotional growth. The heroic climax symbolizes the realization that recovery is a lifelong journey.

## Album art

At the time I was messing around with [Self-avoiding walks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk) in generative artwork explorations. I felt like the whole concept of avoiding the self within the context of addiction and recovery metaphorically worked. So I tweaked some algorithms and generated the self-avoiding walk using JavaScript and the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. I then layered the self-avoiding walk over a [photo I found visually interesting](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-brown-and-yellow-substance-Smpy9LZmksY) on Unsplash using a [CSS blend mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode).

## Jam results

I placed around the top 50% out of over 600 entries. I would have liked to have placed higher, but despite my ranking, I thoroughly enjoyed composing the music! I’m very happy with the music, its production quality, and I also learned a lot. I would certainly participate in this style of composition jam again!
