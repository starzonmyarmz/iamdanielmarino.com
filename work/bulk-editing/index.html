<p>It’s time to review your team’s time before you bill your client. You head over to your trusty Detailed Time Report to see what’s been entered this month before you create an invoice. While skimming the entries, you realize some teammates have accidentally been tracking their time to the wrong project and task!</p>
<p>Historically, this has been a bit of a headache to correct. Fiddling with report filters to hone in on specific entries can be time-consuming—Sometimes flat-out impossible! Your only other option is to manually correct your teammates’ timesheet, chewing up a lot of time.</p>
<p>We’re excited to offer you a much faster and easier option! From the Detailed Time and Expense reports, you can now select individual time and expenses entries to bulk edit.</p>
<p>How to Select Specific Entries for Editing
If you’re a Harvest Administrator, run a Detailed Time or Expense Report. Next, check the boxes next to the entries you’d like to bulk edit. Once you’ve finished selecting entries, click the Actions button, choose your desired action—for example, Move to another task or Mark as uninvoiced, and voilà! Harvest will only include the entries you selected in your bulk action.</p>

If all the entries in the report need to be updated, you can continue to bulk edit the same way you’ve always been able to without having to individually check time or expense entries.</p>
<p>Part of our mission at Harvest is to respect your time and help you maximize it. We hope this new feature is another small step towards that goal!</p>
