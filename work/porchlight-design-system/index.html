<li><strong>Standardization of Components:</strong> Unifying diverse variations of components, retaining only the essential elements. For instance, we found over 60 variations of buttons!</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach not only enhances the cohesiveness of our design elements but also positions us to cultivate a more efficient and harmonized design system.</p>
<h2>Foundations</h2>
<p>Critical to the success of the system was the alignment of all our teams on the foundations. Porchlight is structured to be scaled, meaning that our foundational system needed to account for every potential UI element. Our foundations include a grid system, breakpoints, spacing, and color systems.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/work/pds-foundations.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>In addition, we introduced a typescale based on display headings, utility headings, paragraph styles, and supporting styles. This comprehensive approach ensures scalability and consistency.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/work/pds-colors.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Our color scale enables a branded palette that remains flexible with light and dark color variations while adhering to WCAG AA minimum contrast accessibility standards.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>We've created a comprehensive set of reusable interface elements for integration throughout Harvest products. These elements are constructed on a solid foundation to ensure consistency and durability. They prioritize accessibility, responsiveness, and adherence to Harvest branding, thereby maintaining a uniform experience across our product range. Notable examples include buttons, form inputs, grids, and tables.</p>
