<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Integrate accessibility features into our component libraries, addressing both design and code repositories to ensure a more accessible user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inconsistencies Across Products</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve brand perception and trust through consistent experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Establish uniform experiences that cater to everyone, enabling people to achieve their goals seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>By addressing these concerns and implementing a robust design system, we aimed to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment, fostering better collaboration among teams and elevating our overall brand image.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>While the incorporation of a Design System holds significant potential for enhancing Harvest, our team faced several notable challenges in its adoption:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Migration Process:</strong> Transitioning to a design system posed a challenge due to the extensive number of components distributed across various products and toolchains. The sheer scale of this migration demanded careful planning and execution.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Commitment to Maintenance:</strong> Recognizing that a design system is a dynamic entity, sustained commitment from leadership was crucial. Regular maintenance, requiring dedicated time within our project cadence, was imperative to ensure the system’s continued relevance and effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Decision-Making for System Evolution:</strong> The maintenance process included decisions about incorporating new patterns, modifying existing ones, and potentially phasing out outdated patterns. Apart from the actual implementation, significant time and effort were required to facilitate team discussions and secure buy-in for these decisions. This collaborative aspect was integral to the system’s evolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these hurdles strategically paved the way for a smoother integration of the Design System into our workflow, ultimately optimizing our design and development processes.</p>
<h2>Collaboration and Teamwork</h2>
<p>Working closely with the engineering team, I designed the visual look of the components and collaborated on their implementation by creating the necessary HTML and CSS. This close collaboration helped ensure that the components were both visually consistent and technically feasible across our products.</p>
<p>Our work reduced the design time by <strong>40%</strong> and development time by <strong>25%</strong>, enabling us to ship features faster and with greater consistency.</p>
<h2>UI Inventory</h2>
<p>To gain deeper insights into the current landscape of our design ecosystem, we initiated a comprehensive UI Inventory focusing on our key interface components. We meticulously documented unique instances of critical design assets, encompassing elements such as typography, buttons, icons, input forms, drop-downs, etc., and centralized them within a collaborative Figma file.</p>
<p>This meticulous examination uncovered a multitude of inconsistencies within our design assets, underscoring the imperative for a more methodical approach to documenting, communicating, and sustaining our design system.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/work/pds-inventory.png" alt="Design inconsistencies in Harvest" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>The inventory process proved instrumental in highlighting discrepancies and incongruities throughout our site and product, establishing a robust foundation for our subsequent design system endeavors. Armed with the audit findings, we curated a list of core components that would form the cornerstone of our design system.</p>
<h2>Foundations</h2>
<p>Critical to the success of the system was the alignment of all our teams on the foundations. Porchlight is structured to be scaled, meaning that our foundational system needed to account for every potential UI element. Our foundations include a grid system, breakpoints, spacing, and color systems.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/work/pds-foundations.png" alt="Porchlight Foundations showing breakpoints and spacings" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>We introduced a typescale based on display headings, utility headings, paragraph styles, and supporting styles. This comprehensive approach ensures scalability and consistency.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/work/pds-colors.png" alt="Porchlight Foundations showing palette and color scale" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Our color scale enables a branded palette that remains flexible with light and dark color variations while adhering to WCAG AA minimum contrast accessibility standards.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>We’ve created a comprehensive set of reusable interface elements for integration throughout Harvest products. These elements are constructed on a solid foundation to ensure consistency and durability. They prioritize accessibility, responsiveness, and adherence to Harvest branding, thereby maintaining a uniform experience across our product range. Notable examples include buttons, form inputs, grids, and tables.</p>

<p>To enhance understanding, each component comes with detailed interaction examples, clearly illustrating expected interactive states. These are complemented by specific specifications covering tab stops, keyboard control requirements, spacing, and application.</p>
<p>Moreover, each component undergoes meticulous refinement to accommodate additional breakpoints. This meticulous process ensures our components perform seamlessly across a diverse range of devices, allowing for a consistent and reliable user experience without the need for unnecessary adjustments.</p>
