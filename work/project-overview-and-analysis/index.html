</ul>
<p>Our goal with this section is to make better sense of all the data you put into Harvest. You’ll have a better grasp of budget, profit, costs, and trend.</p>
<p>First New Feature: Tracking Project Costs
Harvest is great at figuring out each project’s billable amount—the key piece of data that you need to get paid and that you use to measure against your budget. To get your project’s full picture, however, you need the flip side of that equation: the project’s costs. What does your project cost you as a business?</p>
<p>Our first new early-access feature allows you to keep track of project costs. Here’s how it will work:</p>
<p>Under Manage &gt; People, you’ll be able to enter a cost rate for each person.
In the new Projects section, each project will display the project’s total cost, as well as costs broken down by team and by task.
All exported reports will have two additional columns—cost rate and cost amount—so you can quickly and easily access this data for your records.
A New Beginning
Over the past seven years, Harvest has steadily grown with you, our customers. When I look at the past—and I literally did that by going back forty-something pages on this very blog—I can see a very clear arc of progression based on customer feedback. We’re listening, and because of you, we’re improving. Our new Projects section is a significant leap forward for Harvest, and we believe it will help you to gain new and different insight into your business.</p>
<p>Sign up for early access today, and you can start using our new features next week.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your support! We’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this new chapter for us here at Harvest.</p>
<p>Update (March 24th, 2014): thanks to everyone who expressed interest in the new Projects section! We received over a thousand sign-ups within the first three days, and we are slowly letting customers in for early access. We are currently working on a crucial feature for the new section. Once it’s ready (we hope by next week), we will invite more early access customers in.</p>
